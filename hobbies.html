                            <p class="card-text">In my spare time at night I like to relax and settle down by watching movies or tv.
                                Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time. I like watching movies because I find it takes me away
                                from everything going on in the world. It allows me to expand my imagination and imagine new worlds
                                within these movies. The same applies for tv, but tv shows usually build a bigger world within to lay a foundation
                                for the audience.

                            <p class="card-text">I am from the Chicago area and grew up watching Chicago sports. I am a massive sports fan in general,
                                but the Bears, Cubs, Bulls, and Blackhawks are my favorite teams. My favorite team out of all of these
                                is probably the Cubs. Second would be the Bulls. The Bears are dead to me since they don't know how to run
                                a competent football team and always leave me heartbroken. But I still love going to all games in Chicago
                                no matter the team (besides the White Sox). There's just something about the atmosphere of being a Chicago sports fan.
                                Especially a Cubs fan.

                            <h5 class="card-title">Running/Exercise</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">I love to be active, whether it's running, lifting, or playing sports. I did cross country in
                                high school, hence the photo. The photo was actually taken at my senior year conference meet, my final race in high school.
                                Yes, that is all mud, and yes it was miserable to run in, but probably the most rewarding race as well. The 
                                thing I love about running is that is hard and it challenges you a lot both physically and mentally. When I hear people
                                complain about running I usually laugh, because I know that if they really pushed themselves and cared they would love it.
                                I love playing other sports as well, like football and basketball. Running is a pretty independent sport,
                                so being able to accomplish things with a team is a different type of reward.
